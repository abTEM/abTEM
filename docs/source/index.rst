The abTEM code: transmission electron microscopy from first principles
======================================================================

.. warning::
   This version of abTEM is decrecated, please see the new documentation for the latest version.


abTEM provides a Python API for running simulations of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy images and diffraction 
patterns. It is written entirely in Python, which enables easy integration with first-principles codes and analysis tools 
accessible from Python, and allows for a simple and intuitive user interface. The computationally demanding parts are 
implemented using jit-compiled Numba code and high-performance libraries, maintaining speed while ensuring portability.

abTEM works with the Atomic Simulation Environment and the density functional theory code GPAW to provide an seamless
environment for simulating images from first principles.

>>> from ase import read
>>> from abtem.waves import PlaneWave
>>> atoms = read('SrTiO.cif')
>>> plane_wave = PlaneWave(sampling=0.01, energy=300e3)
>>> exit_wave = plane_wave.multislice(atoms)
>>> image_wave = exit_wave.apply_ctf(defocus=200, focal_spread=40)
>>> image_wave.show()
