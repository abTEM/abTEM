  abstract = {Simulation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images or diffraction patterns is often required to interpret experimental data. Since nuclear cores dominate electron scattering, the scattering potential is typically described using an independent atom model, which completely neglects valence bonding and its effect on the transmitting electrons. As instrumentation has advanced, new measurements have revealed subtle details of the scattering potential that were previously not accessible to experiment. We have created an open-source simulation code designed to meet these demands by integrating the ability to calculate the potential via density functional theory (DFT) with a flexible modular software design. abTEM can simulate most standard imaging modes and incorporates the latest algorithmic developments. The development of new techniques requires a program that is accessible to domain experts without extensive programming experience. abTEM is written purely in Python and designed for easy modification and extension. The effective use of modern open-source libraries makes our performance highly competitive with existing optimized codes on both CPUs and GPUs. abTEM is designed to work in an interactive Python notebook, allowing us to leverage an extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as the Atomic Simulation Environment and the DFT code GPAW. This creates a seamless and reproducible workflow from defining an atomic structure, calculating molecular dynamics (MD) and electrostatic potentials, to the analysis of results, all in a single, easy-to-read document. This article provides ongoing documentation of abTEM development. In this first version, we show use cases for hexagonal boron nitride, where valence bonding can be detected, a 4D-STEM simulation of molybdenum disulfide including ptychographic phase reconstruction, a comparison of MD and frozen phonon modeling for convergent-beam electron diffraction of a 2.6-million-atom silicon system, and a performance comparison of our fast PRISM algorithm for a decahedral 20000-atom gold nanoparticle.},
