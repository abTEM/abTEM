    "This is a short description on the theory of the multislice simulation method for electron scattering. For a more complete derivation including detailed theory, see Advanced Computing Computing in Electron Microscopy by EJ Kirkland{cite}`kirkland`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In electron microscopy, the energy of the incident electron waves (20 - 1000 keV) are generally much larger than the electrostatic potential wells of the atoms, which we will assume to only provide small perturbations on the forward motion of the electrons. Hence, we write the wave function, $\\psi_{full}$, of the propagating electrons as a slowly varying plane wave along the optical axis, $z$, with a modulation in $x$ and $y$ given by $\\psi(x,y)$\n",

    "where $(x,y,z)$ are the three real-space coordinates and $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons. Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation we obtain\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the high energy approximation, we assume that the wavefunction varies slowly in the $z$-direction compared to the potential and that the wavelength is small, thus\n",

This equation is integrated numerically by slicing the potential into thin slices, such that the influence of each slice can be approximated as a simple phase shift of the wave function. The wave function is propagated between slices as a small angle outgoing wave (Fresnel diffraction). The transmission and propagation across a single slice can be written\n",
