__*ab*TEM: transmission electron microscopy from first principles__

*ab*TEM is a flexible open-source package for simulating transmission electron microscopy experiments. As a Python API,
it allows for easy integration with other simulation codes and analysis tools accessible from Python, while utilization 
of other open-source projects makes *ab*TEM fast and scalable from a laptop to a high-performance computing environment.
