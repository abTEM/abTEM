You can download a .bib file of the reference {download}`here<./abtem.bib>`. 

In addition, we recommend that you also cite the original works of any *relevant* methods and algorithms that your use relies on (e.g. PRISM, GPAW, or potential parametrizations; see [bibliography](../user_guide/bibliography.md)).
