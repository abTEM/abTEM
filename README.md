*ab*TEM (pronounced "ab-tem", as in "*ab initio*") provides a Python API for running simulations of (scanning)
transmission electron microscopy images and diffraction patterns using the multislice or PRISM algorithms. It is
designed to closely integrate with atomistic simulations using the Atomic Simulation
Environment ([ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)), and to directly use *ab initio* electrostatic potentials from the
high-performance density functional theory code [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/). *ab*TEM is open source, purely
written in Python, very fast, and extremely versatile and easy to extend.

## Installation

You can install *ab*TEM using `pip`:

```sh
$ pip install abtem
